## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox Css
- Css Grid

### Time required

Nearly 5 day required to set the idea and get the desired position of the image, all different sections and reponsivness was time consuming.

### What I learned

This is the css design code snippet of the navbar class of Restaurant project. I learned that with grid it was easy to beautifuly placed our sections.

```css
.grid {
  display: grid;
  column-gap: 4.2rem;
  row-gap: 9.6rem;
}
.grid--2-cols {
  grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
}
.grid--3-cols {
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
}
.grid--4-cols {
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
}
.right-section {
  grid-column: 2/4;
  padding: 6.4rem 2rem;
  margin-right: 4.8rem;
}
```

### Continued development

I still have a lot to learn about flexbox and grid. Which will be later implemented to the website with better responsivness and with animations.

### Useful resources

- [IONICONS](https://ionic.io/ionicons) - This websit provided me with free icons, which were very easy to implement.
